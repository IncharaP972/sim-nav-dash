Basic Life Support (BLS) should be initiated for all patients who are unresponsive and not breathing normally. Opening the airway, checking for breathing, and providing rescue breaths are vital steps until advanced help arrives.

For severe external bleeding, always apply firm, direct pressure to the wound, and maintain pressure while elevating the affected limb. Use a tourniquet above the bleeding site if direct pressure fails to control bleeding.

Burn injuries should be cooled with running water for at least 10 minutes and covered with a clean, non-stick bandage. Avoid home remedies or breaking blisters.

Suspected cardiac events require keeping the patient calm, seated, and warm. Administer aspirin if appropriate, and arrange immediate transfer to medical care.
